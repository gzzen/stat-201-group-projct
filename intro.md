# Do changes bring difference: A comparative study of Tottenham’s performance after sacking Jose Mourinho



## Introduction

### Background

 Jose Mourinho, the controversial “special one” was sacked by Manchester United by December 18, 2018 ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46603018)). The Portuguese manager joined the England Premier League soccer club in May 2016, and took the charge for more than 2 years. 

Jose is awarded 4 times of the World’s Best Club Coach since 2003, where he unexpectedly brought FC Porto, the little-known Portuguese club to the position of the European Champoin League winner. In 2010, he coached the underrated Italian club Inter Milan and won two domestic champoinships and the European Champoin League in merely one season. His leadership in Chelsea, another England club carried the entire team to the top of Premier League for 3 times ([Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.us/jose-mourinho/erfolge/trainer/781)). For all his achievements, Jose Mourinho is broadly recognized as one of the greatest all-time soccer managers ([ESPN, 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131023073918/http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1514848/)). 

However, Jose’s prestige uncontrollably fades out when rumours arises about his disputes between players, media or the high-levels in clubs. As the ex-manager of many giant clubs, Jose Mourinho was eventually sacked by Real Madrid ([BBC, 2013](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22583729)), Chelsea ([BBC, 2015](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34670192)) and Tottenham ([BBC, 2021](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56799400)) throughout his coaching path in addition to the United. Nevertheless, the Spurs’ world-class forward Harry Kane expressed his thankfulness to his ex-Boss ([Twitter @HKane](https://twitter.com/HKane/status/1384126605224648716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384126605224648716%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fsport%2Ffootball%2F56799400)).

### Question

Our propose in this study is to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of Manchester United sacking Jose Mourinho. In other words, whether or not such a decision significantly improves the United’ performance in the rest of the Premier League season. The random variable of interest we will investigate is the goal difference in each match, calculated via substracting the scorings by the losing points. Our dataset recorded Manchester United’ goal differences in season 2016/17 and 2017/18 coached by Jose Murinho, and the season 19/20 and 20/21 coached by Ole Gunnar Solskjær. 

38 matches from the 20/21 Premier League season, spread across 17 matches coached by Jose Mourinho, and 21 matches
